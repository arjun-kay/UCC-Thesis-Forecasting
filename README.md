# UCC-Thesis-Forecasting
This project is created to store the code for project done as part of module CS6500

This study focuses on the impact of modern DL models on time series forecasting. Highlights of the elements in study is given below:

  •Is the performance of a SARIMA method significantly different from output ofDeep Learning methods for time series forecasting?
  
  •Will a hybrid model always outperform a vanilla CNN or vanilla LSTM structure?
  
  •Performance of advanced networks like TCN andAttention models compared to vanilla structures.
